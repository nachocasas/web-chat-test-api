# Pager Chat Exercise

Hello candidate! Today we'd like you to create a realtime chat application that allows two or more users to have conversations. Don't worry, we've provided you with a sample backend, all you need to do is create the web client. (You are free to modify the backend if you wish.)

### Required features

- Connect to the backend
- Prompt user for a username when client is connected
- Be able to send and receive messages
- Display messages on all clients with usernames so we know who sent the message
- Show previous messages to new participants
- `<username> is typing...` indicators

#### Optional features

- [Giphy API] integration: during chat, any user can send and receive an animated gif url from the service (you can do this however you want, a search input, `/slash` command, drag and drop, etc)
- During chat any user can send images via links and/or local images and render them in the clients
- Create multiple rooms and/or private chats

### Bonus points

- Use [React] or [Vue] with some kind of Flux architecture.
- Don't use a boilerplate. Create your own architecture, build process, folder structure. Show us your experience.
- Tests and coverage: we're always rushing it, but take your time and write some nice looking tests, think about all those green bars.

### Submitting

Your code goes into a public github repo and a working release should be deployed to Heroku, Firebase, Netlify, Now or similar.

Happy coding!
